# AWS API Gateway Todo API 

This project uses AWS CDK v2 to implement and deploy a REST API using AWS API Gateway and Lambda.

Intended as a proof of concept

This is a bootstrapped project for CDK development with TypeScript.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
